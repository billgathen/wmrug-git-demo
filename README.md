This is a very simple demo app for sudent members of the West Michigan Ruby User Group Traning program to practice using git & github.

If you are a student, please fork the repo from https://github.com/matthew-p/wmrug-git-demo/ into your own github account, clone the repo onto your development computer, create a new branch, within that branch insert your own github name & link on views/index.html.erb, commit the changes, push the change to your fork, then submit a pull request from your github repo for the original author to authorise the pull request & integrate your change.
